Dear Reader,


The mathematical structure of MEA is expressed as a triad:
– MEA_traversal_paper.pdf defines the constructive permutation.
– MEA_centered_operator.pdf provides the operator and geometric interpretation.
– MEA_theorem_appendix.pdf states the invariants and uniqueness theorem.
Each is canonical within its own context.

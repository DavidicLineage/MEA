Abstract

I⁵ is a five-stage Process-Tree Learning Framework that models concept acquisition as a deterministic sequence of cognitive operations. Unlike traditional linear or cyclical learning models, I⁵ defines learning as a state machine with reversible transitions, enabling recursive refinement and self-correction.

The five stages—Illuminate, Elucidate, Explain, Experience, Examine—capture universal processes observed in both biological cognition and machine-learning systems. Each stage has explicit transition conditions, allowing I⁵ to be implemented algorithmically or used diagnostically in human learning.

I⁵ is domain-agnostic and applicable to pedagogy, self-directed learning, reinforcement learning, cognitive therapy, communication, and AI alignment. This document defines the model, diagrams the process tree, compares I⁵ to existing learning theories, and outlines practical applications.

1. Introduction

Learning requires moving from raw perception toward stable, coherent understanding. Existing frameworks, such as Bloom’s Taxonomy, Kolb’s Experiential Cycle, constructivist theory, and modern machine-learning loops, each describe aspects of this process but lack a unified, operational structure.

The I⁵ Process-Tree Framework addresses this gap by modeling learning as a deterministic state-transition system. Each state reflects a fundamental cognitive operation, and the agent transitions between states based on specific, testable criteria.

Because each stage can route backward when errors or gaps occur, I⁵ provides a transparent, recursive learning process suitable for both humans and artificial agents.

2. The Five Stages
2.1 Illuminate

Definition: Recognize that a concept or phenomenon exists.
Function: Attention/awareness threshold crossing.
Machine Analogue: Signal detection, anomaly identification.

Transition:

Perceived but unclear → Elucidate

Not perceived → remain in Illuminate

2.2 Elucidate

Definition: Parse the internal structure of the concept.
Function: Feature extraction, component identification.
Machine Analogue: Embedding formation, clustering, latent-space decomposition.

Transition:

Structure identified → Explain

Structure unclear → Illuminate

2.3 Explain

Definition: Represent the concept coherently in language or internal narrative.
Function: Abstraction, compression, symbolic re-expression.
Machine Analogue: Summarization, schema formation.

Transition:

Representation coherent → Experience

Representation unstable → Elucidate

2.4 Experience

Definition: Encounter examples and non-examples to stabilize semantic boundaries.
Function: Practical grounding; discrimination of edge cases.
Machine Analogue: Reinforcement sampling, contrastive learning, fine-tuning.

Transition:

Boundaries stable → Examine

Boundaries vague → Explain or Elucidate

2.5 Examine

Definition: Perform metacognitive evaluation and error checking.
Function: Validation, generalization, integration.
Machine Analogue: Validation loop, gradient correction.

Transition:

Errors discovered → route backward to correct stage

Stable understanding → End

4. Comparison to Existing Learning Models
Bloom’s Taxonomy

Hierarchical but not operational. Lacks backward routing.
I⁵ adds explicit transitions and recursion.

Kolb’s Experiential Cycle

Emphasizes experience but lacks semantic precision and state delineation.
I⁵ introduces boundary formation and correction.

Constructivism

Conceptually aligned but underspecified in mechanism.
I⁵ provides step-by-step construction logic.

Machine-Learning Models

I⁵ maps cleanly onto ML training loops:

Illuminate → detection

Elucidate → feature extraction

Explain → embedding compression

Experience → reinforcement/contrastive sampling

Examine → validation/testing

5. Applications
Education & Pedagogy

Curriculum scaffolding

Diagnostic evaluation

Accelerated self-learning

Machine Learning & AI Alignment

Transparent agent training

Error routing and self-correction

Interpretable cognitive loops

Cognitive Therapy & Trauma Work

Boundary formation through controlled exposure

Recursive narrative refinement

Stability testing in Examine stage

Communication & Conflict Resolution

Identify breakdown stage precisely

Route back to the correct cognitive operation

6. Limitations

Requires an agent capable of introspection or self-monitoring

Does not model affective/emotional interference

Needs domain-specific calibration for technical fields

Provides process structure but not timing or recursion depth

7. Conclusion

I⁵ provides a practical, deterministic, and extensible framework for learning across domains. By treating learning as a process tree rather than a linear sequence, it enables reversible transitions, clearer diagnostics, and stronger alignment between human and machine cognition.

The simplicity of I⁵ makes it suitable both as a pedagogical tool and as a foundation for more advanced cognitive architectures, meta-learning systems, and conceptual engineering research.
